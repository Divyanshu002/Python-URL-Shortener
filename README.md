# Python URL Shortener

This is a simple Python script that allows you to shorten URLs using the TinyURL API. The script prompts the user to enter a long URL and then uses the pyshorteners library to interface with the TinyURL API and shorten the URL. The resulting shortened URL is printed to the console, and the script also includes additional features such as copying the shortened URL to the clipboard and opening it in a web browser.


# Getting Started

To use the script, you will need to sign up for a TinyURL API key at https://tinyurl.com/app/settings/api and replace 'KEY' in the script with your actual API key. Once you have done this, you can run the script in a Python environment and enter a long URL to get a shortened URL.


# Prerequisites

To use the script, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following libraries:
- pyshorteners 
- pyperclip
- webbrowser


# Usage

To use the script, simply run the Script.py file. Follow the prompts to enter a long URL, and the script will generate a shortened URL using the TinyURL API. The resulting shortened URL will be printed to the console, and you can choose to copy it to the clipboard or open it in a web browser.
